<!-- ## Hi there! This is Yifei Zhang.

- I am currently a third-year undergraduate in the College of Computer Science, Nankai University.

- My research interest is mainly information security and cryptology, with a special focus on authentication and password security. Recently, I have been working on password strength meters, honey encryption and honeyvault schemes.

- Feel free to drop me an email! You can reach me at yifeizhang@mail.nankai.edu.cn.

### Publications:

- **EditPSM: A New Password Strength Meter Based on Password Reuse via Deep Learning**
  
  **Yifei Zhang**, Zhenduo Hou, Yunkai Zou, Zhen Li, Ding Wang. In Proc. INSCRYPT 2024 (**CCF-C**), **Best Paper runner-up** (3 out of 47 total accepted/conditional accept papers). To appear. [[PDF]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/387090294_EditPSM_A_New_Password_Strength_Meter_Based_on_Password_Reuse_via_Deep_Learning) [[video]](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Zhk1YqECC?vd_source=a77cc3ee011649af678918fbe9172a5c)

### Awards:

- Cryptography National Contest'24, China, held by CACR. Finalist, **Second Prize**.

  I personally served as the presenter and drafted/polished the report, completed the artifact in part. In the group phase of the finals, we ranked the first.
  However, in a last minute notice, the score for the preliminary round is also a part of the final score (the prelims took place 2 months before the finals, and was never
  a part of the final result in previous editions of the competition). Due to this sudden change of rules, we lost the chance to win the first prize.

- Contemporary Undergraduate Mathematical Contest in Modeling, National contest'24, China. **Second Prize (Tianjin)**. 

  I personally served as team leader, model designer, and programmer. -->
