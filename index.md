## Hi there! This is Yifei Zhang.

- I am currently a third-year undergraduate in the College of Computer Science, Nankai University. Feel free to drop me an email! You can reach me at yifeizhang@mail.nankai.edu.cn.

- My research interest is mainly information security and cryptology, with a special focus on authentication and password security. Recently, I have been working on password strength meters, honey encryption and honeyvault schemes.

- One purpose of this site is to collected useful things (posts, articles, technical blogs, etc.) that I ran accross. Particularly, I find it very time consuming to look up others' blog posts for problems that I run into occasionally and repeatedly, especially mudane and trivial routinary tasks such as setting up a proxy for virtual machines. Posts and articles for this purpose are mostly reposts of other blog post, serving as a manual that might come in handy.

- Another purpose of this site is to keep track of what I do. Consider posts and articles of this kind as parts of my journal. They may be useful for others, but I mainly keep them here to keep track of things I did.

### Awards:

- Cryptography National Contest'24, China, held by CACR. Finalist, **Second Prize**.

  I personally served as the presenter and drafted/polished the report, completed the artifact in part. In the group phase of the finals, we ranked the first.
  However, in a last minute notice, the score for the preliminary round is also a part of the final score (the prelims took place 2 months before the finals, and was never
  a part of the final result in previous editions of the competition). Due to this sudden change of rules, we lost the chance to win the first prize.

- Contemporary Undergraduate Mathematical Contest in Modeling, National contest'24, China. **Second Prize (Tianjin)**. 

  I personally served as team leader, model designer, and programmer. -->
